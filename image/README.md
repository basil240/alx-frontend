Task 0:
The description of the project contains some inspiration for the final look of the project but we’ll have to download some images.

Head to unsplash and download 10 high resolution images that look as close to the final product that you’re going to make. You will be using these same high res images for a project on Responsive Design in the future. Remember to also include the 3 images (the 2 logos and the favicon) linked in the description of the project.

The images should all be representative of category they belong to. Images in the work category should be closely related to work.
Based on styles/3-style.css:

Targeting the root element, create 2 custom font-family properties font-family-base and font-family-title with the same list of fonts:
set the first choice font as Helvetica Neue
set the second choice font as Helvetica
set the third choice font as Arial
set the last choice font as sans-serif
Set body‘s font-family to font-family-base
Create a new declaration targeting all 6 levels of section headings, positioned before the links declaration
set its font-family to font-family-title
